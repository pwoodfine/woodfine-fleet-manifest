# 🚀 GUIDE: TELEMETRY ENGINE INTEGRATION

**Operator:** Woodfine Management Corp. (Customer)
**Vendor Software:** PointSav Sovereign Telemetry (v1.2.0 - Rust Compiled)

## Execution Protocol
This document proves how Woodfine Operations deploys the generic PointSav Engine into the active corporate fleet to protect investor privacy.

1. **Compilation:** Operations pull the source code to the Tier-2 Cloud Node and execute `cargo build --release` to forge native Linux binaries.
2. **Kernel Locking (systemd):** The `telemetry-daemon` is locked into continuous execution via a Linux `systemd` service, listening on the internal proxy port.
3. **Data Provisioning:** Woodfine edge servers append live traffic to `app-mediakit-telemetry/assets/ledger_telemetry.csv`.
4. **Geographic Brain:** Woodfine injects its licensed `GeoLite2-City.mmdb` into the `assets/` vault.
5. **Ignition (Cron):** The `omni-matrix-engine` fires daily via crontab to synthesize the raw ledgers into 8 institutional tables.
6. **Secure Extraction:** Operations utilize a strictly scoped `rsync` Pull Diode to securely extract `REPORT_WOODFINE.md` back to local terminals.
